# SortingEfficiency
### *Compare the speed of each sorting algorithm by running this code!*

The different sorting algorithms we are using are bubble sort, insertion sort, and quick sort. They are all unique in their own way. 

We will be comparing the speed of the algorithms using the same set of data for them to refer to using a text file. This will allow us to have fair and genuine trials. 

You are the star of the race though. You, the user, gets to choose the size of the dataset they will be sorting, alongside the order (ex. descending or ascending). The set of data that is customized by you is now being set to the seperate different algorithms to sort in their own unique way. After they are done, you will see how long each of the algorithms took to sort the data you selected.
